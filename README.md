# Texture Mapping Assignment

This project demonstrates texture mapping on a 3D cube using Three.js. The cube is textured with six different images and can be rotated automatically or manually using keyboard and mouse controls.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BreadcrumbsUtilizing-Textures-in-Computer-Graphics-ThreeJS
.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd BreadcrumbsUtilizing-Textures-in-Computer-Graphics-ThreeJS
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

- **Automatic Rotation**: The cube will auto-rotate around the x and y axes.
- **Keyboard Controls**:
  - `ArrowUp`: Rotate the cube upwards.
  - `ArrowDown`: Rotate the cube downwards.
  - `ArrowLeft`: Rotate the cube to the left.
  - `ArrowRight`: Rotate the cube to the right.
- **Mouse Controls**:
  - Click and drag the mouse to manually rotate the cube.

## Features

- **Texture Mapping**: Each face of the cube is textured with a different image.
- **Auto-Rotation**: The cube rotates automatically at a specified speed.
- **Manual Controls**: Rotate the cube using keyboard arrow keys or mouse drag.
